# csv_to_map
Csv to Map is a plugin developed in QGIS software using PyQGIS.
This plugin was developed during my internship at Meteorological Center, India Meteorological Department, Bengaluru.
It was basically to automate the process of map making in QGIS for forecast, warning & weather information maps.
