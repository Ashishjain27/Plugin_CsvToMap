# csv_to_map
Csv to Map is a plugin developed in QGIS software using PyQGIS.
This plugin was developed during my internship at Meteorological Center, India Meteorological Department, Bengaluru.
It was basically to automate the process of map making in QGIS for forecast, warning & weather information maps.

The plugin can now ease the process of making 14 different maps, which otherwise was a tedious process using the conventional way of map creation.
Here, the UI is customised as per the requirements of the user and many other minor detailings are iterated as per their needs at IMD.
